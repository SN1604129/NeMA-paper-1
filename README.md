# NeMA-paper-1
NeMA-Lite implements a lightweight differentiable write gate for Transformers to improve long-range reasoning. Instead of storing all tokens or using fixed heuristics, NeMA-Lite learns which hidden states to store in an external memory, reducing redundancy and memory cost. This module forms the WRITE component of the full NeMA architecture.
